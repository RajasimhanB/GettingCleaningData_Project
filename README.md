#H1 GettingCleaningData_Project
Project work for getting and cleaning data project





This repository is for the project work for course era's Getting and Cleaning Data Course. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

As part of this project the following two artifacts are created.

1. R Program run_analysis.R
2. Codebook.md


### Program Description:

The program does the following activities.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


### How to run the program:

In order to execute the program the working directory path set inside the program must be modified. 
Download the zip file 'getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip' and extract it to folder named 'UCI HAR Dataset'. The path of the folder 'UCI HAR Dataset' must 
be updated as the working directory for the program.
